## ❯ Why

After scrapping several API projects and trying out multiple ORMs, I finally settled with TypeORM and building an express application in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a>.  This project focuses on TypeORM integration and thus security features are basic and authentication/authorization has been ommitted.

Try it! I am happy to hear your feedback.

### ❯ Application Goals

- **Simplified Database Query** with the ORM [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm).
- **RESTful API** built with restful principles in mind...
- **Testing Tools** thanks to [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest).
- **Basic Security Features** thanks to [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/).
- **Fast Database Building** with simple migration from [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm).
