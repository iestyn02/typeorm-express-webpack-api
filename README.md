## ‚ùØ Why

After scrapping several API projects and trying out multiple ORMs, I finally settled with TypeORM and building an express application in <a href="https://www.typescriptlang.org/">Typescript</a>.  This project focuses on TypeORM integration and thus security features are basic and authentication/authorization has been ommitted.

Try it! I am happy to hear your feedback.

### ‚ùØ Application Goals

- **Simplified Database Query** with the ORM [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm).
- **RESTful API** built with restful principles in mind...
- **Testing Tools** thanks to [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest).
- **Basic Security Features** thanks to [Helmet](https://helmetjs.github.io/).
- **Fast Database Building** with simple migration from [TypeORM](https://github.com/typeorm/typeorm).

## üìô Database & Environment

It is essential that you setup your database and .env files for the application to run successfully.

This project uses `postgres` by default but you can change that to any DBMS with a few alterations.  Below is a script to create a `demo` schema in your `postgres` database.

#### Create DB Schema

```sql
CREATE SCHEMA demo
AUTHORIZATION YOUR_DB_USER;
```

#### Setup your .env files

Create two environment files, `.env` and `.env.development`, you can refer to [.env.example](https://github.com/iestyn02/typeorm-express-webpack-api/blob/master/.env.example) as an example.

| <sup>Variable</sup> | <sup>Type</sup> | Description                                                                                |
|---------------------|-----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| NODE_ENV            | string          | Node environment, generally development locally and set to production for production build |
| PORT                | number          | Port the API will be served on                                                             |
| POSTGRES_HOST       | string          | Host for your db, generally your localhost if serving locally                              |
| POSTGRES_PORT       | number          | DB port generally 5432                                                                     |
| POSTGRES_DB         | string          | DB you will be accessing                                                                   |

## üõ† Develop

### Requirements
For development, you will only need Node.js installed on your environment.

#### Node

[Node](http://nodejs.org/) is really easy to install.
You should be able to run the following commands after the installation procedure
below.

```
$ node --version
$ v6.10.1
```

## Installation

```
$ git clone git@github.com:iestyn02/typeorm-express-webpack-api.git
$ typeorm-express-webpack-api
$ npm i
```

## Serve Locally

```
$ npm start
```

You will then see a message on your console

## üî¨ Test

This project uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) to perform integration testing on endpoints.

Tests should be writtin in a `*.test.ts` file.

```
./
+--src
|   +--api
|   |   +--v1
|   |   |   +--resource
|   |   |   |   +--resource.route.ts
|   |   |   |   +--resource.controller.ts
|   |   |   |   +--resource.test.ts
```

Just run this command to run the tests

```
$ npm run test
```
